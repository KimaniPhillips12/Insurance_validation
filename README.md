# HealthCost Insights

This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset to prepare it for analysis. The following steps were performed:

1. **Initial Inspection**
   - Displayed the first five rows of the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

2. **Dataset Dimensions**
   - Checked the number of rows and columns to understand the size of the dataset.

3. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Removed rows with missing values to ensure data integrity.
   - Verified that no missing values remain in the dataset.

4. **Standardizing Categorical Data**
   - Standardized the categories in the `region` column to ensure consistency.
   - Simplified the `sex` column to just two categories: `male` and `female`.

5. **Boolean Conversion**
   - Converted the `smoker` column to boolean values (`True` for smokers, `False` for non-smokers).

6. **Data Type Standardization**
   - Ensured the `charges` column is of float type for accurate numerical analysis.

This cleaned dataset is now ready for further exploration and modeling.

7. **Relationships between variables & charges**
   -Scatterplots were then create and between charges and each variables.

8. **Linear Regression Modeling on Insurance Charges**
   -This section of the project focuses on building and evaluating a Linear Regression model to predict medical insurance charges based on various features.
